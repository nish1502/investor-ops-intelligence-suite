# INDMoney Pulse: Production Architecture

This document outlines the production-ready full-stack architecture for the **INDMoney Weekly Product Pulse** system. 

The system is transitioning from a standalone Python script into a robust API-first application with a React-based frontend and containerized backend.

---

## 🏗️ System Overview

The updated architecture separates the pipeline logic into a stateless FastAPI backend and a dynamic Next.js frontend, orchestrated via Docker and automated by GitHub Actions.

## 🚀 Layered Architecture

### 1. Backend Layer (FastAPI)
The central orchestrator transitions from `main.py` to a FastAPI service running in a Docker container.

#### API Design (RESTful)
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/run` | `POST` | Triggers the full pipeline as a **background task**. Returns immediately. |
| `/status` | `GET` | Returns current system state (`idle`, `running`, `failed`) and last run metadata. |
| `/report` | `GET` | Fetches the latest synthesized report, theme data, and fee explanation. |
| `/send-email` | `POST` | Sends the current report to a specified email address (Approval-Gated in UI). |
| `/export-notes` | `POST` | Appends current pulse + fee data to a persistent intelligence doc (MCP-simulated). |
| `/health` | `GET` | Returns system status and API uptime. |

### 🛠️ Key Architectural Controls

#### A. Pipeline Flow (Approval-Gated)
The system follows an "Extract-Synthesize-Review-Dispatch" model:
1.  **Extract & Synthesize**: `/run` executes Phases 1, 2, 3, and 5 automatically.
2.  **Review**: The user reviews the output via the `/report` endpoint on the frontend.
3.  **Dispatch (Gated)**: Phase 4 (Email) and Phase 6 (Notes Export) are only triggered via explicit user action from the dashboard.

#### B. Fee Explainer Module (Phase 5)
A specialized LLM prompt converts raw internal fee structures into a user-friendly 6-bullet explanation.
- **Scenario Focus**: Covers common charges (e.g., US Stock Withdrawal Fee or Mutual Fund Exit Load).
- **Compliance**: Uses neutral, facts-only tone with official source links.

#### C. Intelligence Export (Phase 6 - MCP)
Simulates a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server integration to append results to external notebooks or documentation systems.
- **Schema**: `{ date, weekly_pulse, fee_scenario, explanation_bullets, source_links }`.

### 2. Frontend Layer (Next.js)
A modern, responsive web interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

**Core UI Features:**
- **Dashboard Overview**: Displays top themes, impact scores, and sentiment trends.
- **Report Viewer**: Renders the full markdown report and fee explanation dynamically.
- **Control Center**: Manual trigger buttons for the pipeline, email delivery, and notes export.
- **Progress Tracking**: Uses polling on `/status` to show real-time stage updates to the user.

## 🛠️ Infrastructure & Deployment

### Data Persistence Notice
The `/output` directory is mapped as a local volume in Docker. However, in standard Railway/Docker deployments, this storage is **ephemeral**. 
- Data will persist across container restarts but may be lost on new deployments or if the disk is wiped.
- **MCP Integration**: Designed to bridge this gap by pushing final results to persistent external platforms.

### Scheduling (GitHub Actions)
The weekly scheduler is updated to be status-aware:
1. Call `GET /status`.
2. Proceed to call `POST /run` **only if** the status is `idle`.
3. Log an alert if the system is stuck in `running` or `failed` state.
