# INDMoney Pulse: Automated Weekly Product Intelligence

**INDMoney Pulse** is an AI-powered pipeline that transforms thousands of Play Store reviews into a sharp executive report, identifies key product themes, and provides structured explanations for common fee scenarios.

## 🏗️ System Overview

- **Frontend (Next.js)**: [indmoney-pulse.vercel.app](https://indmoney-pulse.vercel.app/)
- **Backend (FastAPI)**: [indmoney-pulse-production.up.railway.app/docs](https://indmoney-pulse-production.up.railway.app/docs)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Deployment Notice**: Phase 4 (Email SMTP) and Phase 6 (Intelligence Notes Export) are only operational in the **Local Development Environment**. These features are disabled in the Railway/Vercel production build due to free-tier outbound port restrictions and ephemeral storage limitations.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is a full-stack application composed of:
- **FastAPI Backend**: Orchestrates a 6-phase AI pipeline (Ingestion, Theme Engine, Pulse Synthesis, Email, Fee Explainer, and MCP Intelligence Export).
- **Next.js Frontend**: A high-fidelity dashboard for product managers to monitor system status, review reports, and trigger manual "approval-gated" exports.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Environmental Setup
Ensure your `.env` (in the `backend/` directory) contains:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key
EMAIL_ID=your_gmail
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_password
```

### 2. Run the Application
Start the backend and frontend services using the provided Docker configuration or manually:

**Backend (FastAPI)**:
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001
```

**Frontend (Next.js)**:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## 🛠️ Pipeline Modules (Phases 1-6)

1.  **Phase 1: Ingestion & Redaction**: Fetches public reviews (last 12 weeks), scrubs PII, and exports to both JSON and CSV.
2.  **Phase 2: AI Theme Engine**: Small-batch classification (Groq) followed by high-level theme consolidation.
3.  **Phase 3: Pulse Synthesis**: Generates a prioritized, <250-word executive report.
4.  **Phase 4: Email Automation (SMTP)**: Delivers reports via Gmail SMTP (Manual approval-gated).
5.  **Phase 5: Fee Explainer (Exit Load)**: Generates a structured (≤6 bullet) explanation for "Mutual Fund Exit Loads" with official source links.
6.  **Phase 6: Intelligence Export (MCP)**: Appends the pulse and fee results to a persistent `intelligence_notes.md` file, simulating a Model Context Protocol (MCP) action.

## 🎯 PM Handbook Rules
- **No Praise**: The pulse focuses only on friction and growth opportunities.
- **Strictly 3x3x3**: Every report contains exactly 3 themes, 3 quotes, and 3 actionable ideas.
- **Financial Risk First**: Any [HIGH] priority action must address transactional or financial safety.
- **Fact Discovery**: The Fee Explainer is strictly informational and contains no recommendations or comparisons.

## 🛠️ How to Re-Run & Approve
1.  **Trigger Analysis**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/run`. Wait for `GET /status` to return `idle`.
2.  **Approve Email**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/send-email -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"recipient": "your_email@example.com"}'`.
3.  **Approve Notes Export**: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/export-notes`.
4.  **View Results**: Checks the `output/` directory for updated artifacts.

## 🧠 AI Product Thinking: The PM Perspective

Building an AI Pulse system for a FinTech app like **INDMoney** requires balancing automated volume processing with risk-aware synthesis.

### 1. From Noise to Intelligence (Filtering)
In a typical week, INDMoney receives thousands of reviews, many of which are non-actionable (e.g., "Good app," "Payment failed").
- **Product Strategy**: The pipeline uses a two-tier LLM engine. Large models (Llama-3-70b) consolidate high-level themes, while fast models (Llama-3-8b) classify individual reviews. This ensures that the generated **Weekly Pulse** reflects the true distribution of friction, not just outliers.

### 2. Constraint-Driven Readability
Executives and Product Owners don't have time to read 400 reviews.
- **Decision Matrix**: We enforce a **"Strict 3x3x3"** output constraint. By forcing the AI to select only the top 3 themes, 3 quotes, and 3 ideas, we ensure the report is dense with high-impact "signal."

### 3. Trust Through Neutrality (The Fee Explainer)
Fee scenarios (like Mutual Fund Exit Loads) are high-risk areas from a support perspective. Incorrect or misleading AI-generated advice can lead to compliance issues. 
- **Product Safeguard**: The **Fee Explainer** is prompted with a strict "Facts-Only" persona and required to include official INDMoney source links for every bullet point. This ensures the output is verifiable and neutral.

### 4. Human-In-The-Loop Approval Gating
Automation should not equal total autonomy.
- **Workflow Control**: We explicitly designed the **Email Draft** and **Intelligence Notes** as "Approval-Gated" actions. An AI can synthesize the data, but a human must trigger the final dispatch to stakeholders. This preserves accountability while unlocking efficiency.

### 🛡️ Disclaimer
This project is for educational/demonstrative purposes. The fee explanation is generated via AI and should be cross-verified with official documentation before financial decisions. No PII is stored or transmitted.
